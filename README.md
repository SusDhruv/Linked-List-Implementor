# Linked List Implementation in C++

This C++ code provides a basic implementation of a linked list. The code is created by Ganeshaanand (Rishi) Balasubramanian, a Master of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada (2022).

## Linked List Overview

The linked list implementation consists of a `LinkNode` class representing a node in the linked list. Each node has two fields: `key`, which stores the data for the node, and `next`, which points to the next node in the list.

## Functions

The code includes the following functions:

- `RootIns`: Inserts a new node at the root of the linked list.
- `SpecificIns`: Inserts a new node at a specific point in the linked list.
- `EndIns`: Inserts a new node at the end of the linked list.
- `display`: Prints the contents of the linked list.
- `Remove`: Removes a node from the linked list.
- `RemoveSpecific`: Removes a specific node from the linked list.
- `ListLength`: Returns the number of nodes in the linked list.
